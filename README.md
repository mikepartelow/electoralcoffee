# 2020 Biden Victory Coffee Project

I like coffee, Joe Biden, maps, projects, and economic stimulus. What happens if I roll all that into one big mess on the web?  

I am going to buy, drink, and review coffee from every electoral district Joe Biden won in 2020.  

See it [here](https://mikepartelow.com/victorycoffee).  

Support your local coffee roaster! And your out of state roaster, too.
