            "tasting_notes": "Claim: Blueberries. Verdict: BLUEBERRIES. I don't like-like bright espresso, but I can often appreciate it. Sermon is the exception. Exquisitely balanced to delight whether you prefer bright berry-forward shots or syrupy chocolate. It's got both, which is rare in my experience. Other espressos this bright trend sour and thin if you don't nail the parameters, but Sermon is delicious and full bodied across a wide range of parameters/mistakes. I used to think I didn't like Verve. I'm glad I gave them another try, this is now among my favorite espressos."
