            "tasting_notes": "To my eye, it looks a lot darker than \"light\". But it's definitely a light roast in the sense of Not Burning Away The Flavors, so who cares what color I think it is? In the cup, this is possibly the best coffee I've had all year. There's a burnt caramel pointedness - honestly the rest doesnâ€™t matter since the burnt caramel is so compelling to me. But the rest is also wonderful: floral, surprisingly delightful heavy body, clean sweet finish that evaporates to a chocolate presence. Over delivers. My new favorite roaster."

            "tasting_notes": "My first shot was bursting with potential, and even not dialed in yet, deliciously satisfying and already a favorite. After one shot! Savory at first, muddled flavor (my fault: not dialed in yet), syrupy thick, giving way to a sweetness that informs me what \"sweetness\" is supposed to mean in coffee. Long, delightful chocolate finish. I didn't get the fruit/berries. I will keep looking! Reminds me of my West Coast favorite Timeless. Looking forward to my next shot."
