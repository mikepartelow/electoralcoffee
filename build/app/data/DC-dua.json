Thick body, complex triple-axis of flavor, satisfying. Roaster's notes say \"floral\". Yeah, that too. White wine notes. Wonderful! Dua outsources their roasting to Mayorga Organics."

Not chocolatey, but juicy raisiny. Good thing I like raisins. I love this coffee! Dua outsources their roasting to Mayorga Organics."
