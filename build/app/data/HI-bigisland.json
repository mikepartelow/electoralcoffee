            "tasting_notes": "Deliciously sweet, with a surprising roasty backbone. Honeyed body. Light chocolate. \"U shaped\" flavor profile, highs and lows with a muted middle. Extremely delicious. Roaster's tasting notes say \"buttery\". Yes!"

Very tasty, very mellow. Darker roast than I prefer but skillfully done to preserve, not destroy, flavor. I want to say this isn't my favorite because it's too dark, but I keep tasting the raisins and they're enchanting."

            "tasting_notes": "Magical! Syrupy/honeyed thick, sweet, milk chocolatey. A mouthfeel so velvety and lush I almost forgot to taste it. Lasting enticing finish. Excellent on its own terms, not reminiscent of my favorite burnt-caramel style, not like the currently fashionable South American/African blends. I didn't imagine 100% Hawaiian coffee could make decent espresso. Now I know it can make outstanding espresso, with the right roaster!"
