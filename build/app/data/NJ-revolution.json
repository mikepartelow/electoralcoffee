            "tasting_notes": "Disappointingly, no roast date on any of the 3 bags. Seems fresh-ish. Monsooned Malabar is a unique bean with unique properties, so it's tricky to guess freshness  by eyeballing the brew. For some reason it's rare to find delicious Monsooned Malabar at a coffee shop. In my experience, anybody who sells it has it in stock mainly for their Vivace-style epresso blend, and if so, I will like their espresso blend. This one has a bitter attack that vanishes after a few sips, giving way to a dense, funky/nutty chocolate smoothness. Nice dense body, a hint of round sweetness, and plenty of complexity. It's roasted a little lighter than I expected but it's still darker than 'medium', as advertised. Some roasters char their Monsooned Malabar, this roaster didn't. I dig it!"

Successfully in the style of Espresso Vivace. Darker than most, but skillfully blended to produce a tasty beverage with a pleasant body. Low acidity but it turns out there's lots of complexity to be presented even without fruity, sour, or sweet notes. I like it a lot. Easy to pull a tasty shot. Delicious over a wide range of parameters."
