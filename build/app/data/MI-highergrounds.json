            "tasting_notes": "Roasters call this a Dark roast, but it is far short of the oily ashiness that I would call Dark. In other words, it's the perfect roast level for modern espresso. Complex and mysterious, silky, heavy body. Jolting berries and somewhat sharp acidity up front, revealing a delightfully unexpected long-lasting chocolate aftertaste. A wonderfully interesting espresso, endlessly variable with something new to discover in every shot. Where does that chocolate come from? It sticks around."
