            "tasting_notes": "Dizzying depths of flavor, astonishing complexity all biased toward _delicious_. Rewarding of careful tasting, but so delicious it's easy to forget about being a snob and just enjoy the beverage. Taste the cherries. Taste the baking spice. Taste the chocolate. From farmer to roaster, there's incredible skill on display here. Good luck finding a better roaster than Brandywine."
